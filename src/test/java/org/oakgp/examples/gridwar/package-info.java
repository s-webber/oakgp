/**
 * Grid War
 * <p>
 * Grid War is a two-player turn-based zero-sum board game. It is played on a 4x4 grid. Players take turns to move. Players can move one square at a time in one
 * of four directions (up, down, left or right). If a player selects a move that would cause them to exit the board then they forfeit their turn. A player wins
 * if they move to a square that is already occupied by their opponent. A player loses if they move in the same direction on two consecutive moves.
 * </p>

 * The game is described in the O'Reilly book "Programming Collective Intelligence" by Tony Segaran (ISBN 978-0-596-52932-1). <a
