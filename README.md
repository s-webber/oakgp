OakGP is a [genetic programming](http://www.oakgp.org/introduction-to-genetic-programming) (GP) framework written in Java. Genetic programming is part of the evolutionary computation subfield of artificial intelligence. Genetic programming uses techniques inspired by biological evolution to evolve computer programs that perform user-defined tasks. OakGP uses tree data structures to represent the programs it generates.

Please visit [oakgp.org](http://www.oakgp.org/) for more details. The website includes the following examples of how genetic programming can be used to automatically generate programs:

- [Symolic Regression](http://www.oakgp.org/symbolic-regression)
- [Grid War](http://www.oakgp.org/grid-war)
- [Towers of Hanoi](http://www.oakgp.org/towers-of-hanoi)
