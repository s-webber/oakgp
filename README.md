OakGP is a genetic programming (GP) framework written in Java. Genetic programming is part of the evolutionary computation subfield of artificial intelligence. Genetic programming uses techniques inspired by biological evolution to "evolve" computer programs that perform user-defined tasks. OakGP uses tree data structures to represent the programs it generates.
